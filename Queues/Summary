1 .Linear data structures maintain their data in an ordered fashion .
2 .Stacks are simple data structures that maintain a LIFO, last-in first-out, ordering .
3 .The fundamental operations for a stack are push, pop, and isEmpty .
4 .Queues are simple data structures that maintain a FIFO, first-in first-out, ordering .
5 .The fundamental operations for a queue are enqueue, dequeue, and isEmpty .
6 .Prefix, infix, and postfix are all ways to write expressions .
7 .Stacks are very useful for designing algorithms to evaluate and translate expressions .
8 .Stacks can provide a reversal characteristic .
9 .Queues can assist in the construction of timing simulations .
10.Deques are data structures that allow hybrid behavior like that of stacks and queues .
11.The fundamental operations for a deque are addFront, addRear, removeFront, removeRear, and isEmpty .
12.Lists are collections of items where each item holds a relative position .
13.A linked list implementation maintains logical order without requiring physical storage requirements .
